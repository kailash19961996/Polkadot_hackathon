# Polkadot Transaction Analysis Tool

### AI-Powered

## Overview

Introducing CryptoSight AI – a cutting-edge tool designed to bring clarity and security to Polkadot cryptocurrency transactions. What sets CryptoSight AI apart is its powerful 3D visualization feature. You can explore transactions in a dynamic, three-dimensional space, making it easier than ever to spot irregularities.

With our advanced machine learning algorithms, CryptoSight AI identifies outliers within transaction data, flagging anything suspicious. These outliers are then cross-referenced against a list of sanctioned accounts, ensuring that any potential risks are caught early.

Plus, with real-time data analysis, you have control over how many transactions to review, from the most recent one hundred to a thousand. At the top of the screen, simply select the frequency and the number of transactions you want to analyze.

CryptoSight AI isn’t just a tool—it’s your new vantage point for safeguarding cryptocurrency transactions. See the unseen and stay ahead with CryptoSight AI.

## Features

- **Customizable Data Processing**: Users can choose the frequency and volume of data to process.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Displays suspicious senders and receivers based on transaction patterns.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers.
- **Blacklist Checking**: Identified outliers are cross-referenced with blacklisted accounts.
- **Interactive Graphs**: 2D and 3D graphs for visualizing transaction patterns.
- **Detailed Information**: Hover over nodes or connections to view transaction details.

## How It Works

1. **Data Selection**: Users specify the amount and frequency of data to analyze.
2. **Initial Analysis**: The system calculates average transaction values to identify potential suspicious activities.
3. **Machine Learning Detection**: An Isolation Forest algorithm is applied to spot outliers, which are marked as red X's on the graph.
4. **Blacklist Verification**: Outliers are checked against a list of blacklisted accounts.
5. **Visualization**: All outliers are displayed on 2D and 3D graphs for pattern analysis.
6. **Detailed Inspection**: Users can hover over graph elements to view more transaction details.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more complex rules for identifying suspicious transactions.
- Expand machine learning capabilities for more accurate outlier detection.
- Integrate additional data sources for comprehensive analysis.
